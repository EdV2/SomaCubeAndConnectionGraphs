# SomaCubeAndConnectionGraphs
SNAP! and Edgy source files and some resulting cube and connection graphs of the 240 unique Soma cube puzzle solutions
The files - are run in SNAP! App Edgy - http://snapapps.github.io/edgy/ for info and https://snapapps.github.io/edgy/app/edgy.html to run

SomaTableTry1.xml - takes input from a row of AllSolutionsStringFormat1to27_2Review.csv and makes a cube.dot file

Cube2ConnectionGraph.xml - takes cube.dot file as input and makes a Cube2ConnectionGraph.dot file

AllSolutionsStringFormat1to27_2Review.csv - imported and handcrafted from the results found here - 
All solutions of the Soma cube puzzle
