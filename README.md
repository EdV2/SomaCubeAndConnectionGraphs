# SomaCubeAndConnectionGraphs
SNAP! and Edgy source files and some resulting cube and connection graphs of the 240 unique Soma cube puzzle solutions
The files - are run in SNAP! App Edgy - http://snapapps.github.io/edgy/ for info and https://snapapps.github.io/edgy/app/edgy.html to run

SomaTableTry1.xml - takes input from a row of AllSolutionsStringFormat1to27_2Review.csv and makes a cube.dot file

Cube2ConnectionGraph.xml - takes cube.dot file as input and makes a Cube2ConnectionGraph.dot file
Cube2ConnectionGraph2OneClick_RedGreenFix.xml - fixes Green Red connection count error

AllSolutionsStringFormat1to27_2Review.csv - imported and handcrafted from the results found here - 
All solutions of the Soma cube puzzle
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X85901608

cube.dot - output example from SomaTableTry1.xml

Cube2ConnectionGraph1.dot - output example from Cube2ConnectionGraph.xml

SomaCubeGraphs.zip - zip file of the "cube graphs" made from AllSolutionsStringFormat1to27_2Review.csv. These files can be imported onto the "stage" of Edgy
for viewing and analysis

Cube2ConnectionGraphs1.zip - zip file of both the cube graph and the connection graph.  There is an overcount of Green to Red connections which has been fixed in 
Cube2ConnectionGraph2OneClick_RedGreenFix.xml
